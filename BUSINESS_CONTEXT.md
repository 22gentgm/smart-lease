# Smart Lease - Business Context Document

**Founder:** Grayson
**Date:** February 14, 2026
**Status:** Pre-revenue, Planning Stage
**Advisor:** Wesley (Anderson Center for Entrepreneurship, UT Knoxville)

## Business Overview

**Smart Lease** is a student housing platform designed specifically for University of Tennessee Knoxville students. It solves the fragmented, time-consuming, and frustrating process of finding off-campus housing by centralizing apartment discovery, roommate matching, and verified reviews into one mobile-first application.

**Tagline Concept:** "Putting the power back in the student's hands."

## The Problem

When a UT student wants to find off-campus housing today:

1. They Google "apartments in Knoxville"
2. Click on the top 3 results (individual apartment websites)
3. Manually sift through floor plans and pricing on each site
4. No easy way to compare price-to-quality across properties
5. They start an application only to discover halfway through that it's out of budget or not what they expected
6. Reviews on Google/Yelp are unreliable (bots, paid fake 5-star reviews)
7. Finding subleases requires Facebook groups
8. Roommate matching is essentially random

**Core pain points:** Wasted time, hidden information, no comparison tools, untrustworthy reviews, no roommate vetting.

## Target Market

### Primary Users (Students)
- **Total UT enrollment (Fall 2025):** 40,421 students
- **Freshman class size (Fall 2025):** 7,143 (largest in UT history)
- **Addressable market:** ~33,000+ sophomores and above actively needing off-campus housing
- **Recurring demand:** ~7,000 new freshmen each year who will transition to off-campus housing
- **Primary target:** Freshmen transitioning to sophomore year (first-time off-campus renters)
- **Secondary target:** Upperclassmen switching apartments year to year

### Supply Side (Properties)
- **~15 apartment complexes** serve the UT student market
- **Grayson has relationships with 2-3** local properties already
- Property managers are the supply-side partners who provide listings

---

## Revenue Model

### Phase 1 (Launch): Advertising
- Apartment complexes pay to advertise on the platform
- Not random ads. Targeted apartment and housing-related advertising
- Direct ad deals with local properties

### Phase 2 (Growth): Lead Generation Commissions
- Smart Lease delivers qualified tenants to property managers
- Commission/referral fee per signed lease
- Value prop to landlords: "Free tenants with zero advertising spend on your end"

---

## Product Vision

### App Experience (Mobile-First)
- **UI Style:** Modern social media feel (Instagram/TikTok/Yik Yak inspired)
- **Navigation:** Bottom nav bar with 5-6 tabs
- **Onboarding:** First name, last name, email, phone number collection

### Full Feature Set (6 Features)

#### 1. Smart Match (Home) - MVP
The core feature. A Google Survey-style preference quiz:

- What's your budget?

#### 3. Roommate Finder - MVP
- Tinder-style matching for compatible roommates
- Eliminates the stress of random roommate assignment
- Viral potential (students will share this with friends)

#### 4. Map View - Phase 2
- Interactive map of all ~15 apartment complexes in the UT area
- Hover/tap for summary, price comparison, quick details
- Overlaps with Smart Match but provides visual browsing

#### 5. AI Lease Assistant - Phase 2

## Competitive Landscape

- **No direct competitor** in the student-specific housing niche
- **Zillow:** Real estate/house focused, not student housing
- **Apartments.com:** General rental market, not student-focused
- **Facebook Groups:** Used for subleases but not purpose-built
- **Individual apartment websites:** Fragmented, no comparison tools

**Smart Lease's moat:** Hyper-focused on the student experience with features (roommate matching, verified student reviews, preference-based matching) that general platforms don't offer.

---

## Founder Profile

- **Grayson:** Solo founder, non-technical background
- **Potential co-founder:** One person interested in partnering
- **Technical skills:** No coding or web development experience
- **Strengths:** Deep understanding of the problem (lives it), relationships with local properties, strong vision

---

## Resources

- **Budget:** ~$3,000 available
- **Additional funding:** 5 pitch competitions planned
- **Advisory:** Anderson Center for Entrepreneurship (Wesley)
- **Timeline:** App and website live by August 2026 (6 months)

## Key Decisions to Make

1. Tech stack and build approach (given non-technical founder and $3k budget)
2. Whether to launch as mobile app, web app, or both
3. Roommate matching algorithm design
4. Review verification process details
5. Apartment data collection method (manual vs. API vs. partnerships)
6. Marketing strategy for launch (campus presence, social media, etc.)
7. Co-founder decision and role definition
