|---|---|---|
| **Instagram** | Create @smartlease. Post apartment tips, housing memes, "coming soon" content | Free |

| **Word of mouth** | Tell every friend. Beta testers tell their friends. | Free |
| **Student orgs** | Partner with SGA, Greek life, housing organizations | Free |
| **Flyers** | QR code flyers in dorms, student center, libraries | $100-200 |
| **Beta program** | "Be one of the first 100 users" exclusivity | Free |

---

## Launch Week (August)

| Action | Details |
|---|---|
| **Move-in day presence** | Be at the dorms. Hand out flyers. QR codes everywhere. |
| **Social media blitz** | Launch announcement across all channels |
| **Student org partnerships** | Have orgs share with their members |
| **Apartment partner promotion** | Partner apartments mention Smart Lease to new tenants |
| **Referral program** | "Invite 3 friends, get featured in roommate finder" |

---

## Growth Levers

1. **Roommate Finder is inherently viral.** One student uses it, they need roommates on the app too.
2. **Reviews are a content moat.** 50+ verified reviews = students come just to read them.
3. **Seasonal demand.** Housing search peaks January-March. Time marketing pushes accordingly.

---

## Competitive Positioning

**Tagline:** "Putting the power back in the student's hands."

**Key differentiators to message:**
- Only platform focused specifically on student housing
- Verified reviews from real tenants (not bots or paid reviews)
- Roommate matching (no more random roommates)
- Free for students

**What Smart Lease is NOT:**
- Not Zillow (that's for houses and general rentals)
- Not Apartments.com (that's for everyone, not students)
- Not Facebook Groups (that's disorganized chaos)

---

## Content Strategy

### Content Pillars
1. **Apartment tips** - "5 things to check before signing a lease"
2. **Student housing humor** - Memes about apartment hunting struggles
3. **Feature previews** - Screenshots and demos of the app
4. **Verified reviews** - Highlight real student reviews
5. **Roommate stories** - Success stories from matched roommates

### Posting Cadence
- Instagram: 3-4 posts/week + daily stories
- TikTok: 2-3 videos/week
- Start 3 months before launch (May)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low adoption | Medium | High | Focus on roommate finder (viral) and reviews (useful anytime) |
| Apartments don't partner | Low | Medium | They get free tenants. Start with existing relationships. |
| Competitor enters | Low | Medium | First-mover at UT. Build review moat fast. |
| Not enough reviews at launch | Medium | Medium | Seed with personal network. Offer incentives. |

## Phase 2 Growth (Post-Launch)

### Expansion to Other Universities (2027)
- Start with Tennessee schools: Vanderbilt, Memphis, MTSU
- Each university = new market of 10,000-40,000 students
- Same playbook: local apartment data + campus marketing

### Revenue Evolution
- **Phase 1:** Apartment advertising on the platform
- **Phase 2:** Lead generation commissions per signed lease
- **Phase 3:** Premium features, partnerships (moving services, furniture rental)
