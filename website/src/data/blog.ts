Sometimes things don't go as planned — you need to transfer, study abroad, or your roommate bails. Here's what UT Knoxville students need to know about breaking a lease in Tennessee.

## Know Your Lease Terms First

Before doing anything, read your lease. Look for:

- **Early termination clause** — Some leases let you break early if you pay a fee (usually 2 months' rent). This is the cleanest option.
- **Sublease clause** — Many student apartments allow subleasing. If yours does, you can find someone to take over your lease. Check our [sublease board](/subleases) to post yours.
- **Military/domestic violence clause** — Tennessee law (T.C.A. § 66-28-512) allows early termination for active military orders or domestic violence situations.

## Tennessee Landlord Obligations

Tennessee requires landlords to make "reasonable efforts" to re-rent your unit after you leave (T.C.A. § 66-28-507). This means they can't just let it sit empty and charge you for the full remaining lease. They must:

1. List the unit for rent
2. Show it to prospective tenants
3. Accept reasonable applicants

You're only responsible for rent until a new tenant moves in (plus any early termination fees in your lease).

## Steps to Break Your Lease

1. **Read your lease carefully** — Use our [Lease Help tool](/lease-help) to scan for key clauses.
2. **Talk to your landlord first** — Be upfront. Many student housing managers deal with this regularly and may offer options.
3. **Get everything in writing** — Any agreement to end early should be documented.
4. **Try to sublease** — If your lease allows it, post on our [sublease board](/subleases). This is often the cheapest route.
5. **Document the unit** — Take photos/videos of the condition when you leave to protect your security deposit.

## What It Typically Costs

- **Early termination fee**: Usually 1-2 months' rent
- **Lost security deposit**: Possible if not handled properly
- **Rent until re-rented**: Could be 1-3 months depending on demand

## The Bottom Line

Breaking a lease isn't ideal, but it's not the end of the world. Most student apartments in Knoxville have experience with this. The key is communicating early, knowing your rights, and documenting everything.

A bad roommate can ruin your entire year. A great one can become a lifelong friend. Here's how to find the right one.

## What Actually Matters

Forget surface-level stuff. The things that make or break a roommate situation are:

**Sleep schedule** — If you're an early bird and they're a night owl, you'll both be miserable. This is the #1 compatibility factor.

**Cleanliness standards** — You don't have to be identical, but you need to be close. A 2/5 and a 5/5 living together will create resentment fast.

**Guest/noise habits** — How often do they have people over? Are weeknights study time or social time? Get specific.

**Budget alignment** — If you can't agree on a price range, you can't agree on an apartment.

## Questions to Ask Before Committing

Don't just ask "are you clean?" — everyone says yes. Ask specific scenarios:

- "If dishes sat in the sink for 2 days, would that bother you?"
- "How late do you typically stay up on weeknights?"
- "How often do you have friends over?"
- "What's your budget per person per month?"
- "Do you have or want pets?"
- "Do you smoke or drink at home?"

## Red Flags

Watch out for:
- They can't give straight answers about budget
- They've had problems with "every" previous roommate
- They want to skip the lease or go informal
- They pressure you to decide immediately
- They avoid talking about cleaning or guest expectations

## Use SmartLease Roommate Finder

Our [Roommate Finder](/roommates) matches you based on the things that actually matter — sleep schedule, cleanliness (1-5 scale), noise level, guest frequency, study habits, budget range, and move-in date.

Here's how it works:

1. **Create your profile** — Takes 2 minutes. Be honest about your habits.
2. **Browse matches** — We show you compatible profiles sorted by compatibility percentage.
3. **Match or pass** — Like Tinder, but for roommates. If you both match, you'll see each other's email to connect.
4. **Filter by apartment** — Already know where you want to live? Filter to see only people interested in the same complex.

The key is honesty. The more accurate your profile, the better your matches will be. Nobody wants to discover their "clean" roommate is actually a 2/5 after signing a 12-month lease.
