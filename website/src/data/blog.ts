Ok so there's like 21+ apartment complexes near UT and they all blur together after a while. We spent way too long comparing them so here's the cheat sheet.

## Walking Distance (Under 0.3 Miles)

If you want to wake up 15 minutes before class and still make it on time:

**Hub Knoxville** (0.1 mi) — Basically everyone and their mom lives here. Pool, gym, study rooms. Around $1,174/mo. It's popular for a reason but good luck getting a parking spot.

**The Standard** (0.1 mi) — Right on campus. They do flash sales on 2x2 and 4x4 units sometimes so keep an eye out. Around $1,335/mo.

**TENN** (0.1 mi) — Newer and nicer. Great pool area if that matters to you. Around $1,340/mo.

**The Knox** (0.2 mi) — Honestly underrated. Highest student ratings we've seen (4.6 stars) and only $850/mo which is wild for being that close.

## Cheapest Options (Under $900/mo)

For when your parents say "we're not paying $1,300 a month":

**The Woodlands** (2.9 mi) — $720/mo, cheapest you'll find. It's out there though. You're driving or taking the shuttle every day.

**The Heights** (2.3 mi) — $759/mo and they have a shuttle which helps. Solid if you have a car anyway.

**Tradition at Knoxville** (0.3 mi) — $799/mo and actually close to campus which is rare at this price. Use code LIVETRAD for a free app fee.

**The Knox** (0.2 mi) — Shows up again here. $850/mo, 0.2 miles. Hard to beat.

## Best Amenities

**303 Flats** — The pool scene is real here. Free parking or $1,500 off for the first 10 leases. 4.8 star rating which is nuts.

**Slate at 901** — If you're the type who goes to every event and wants to know your neighbors, this is the spot.

**The Mark** — Feels more upscale. Pool, gym, study rooms, furnished. $500 gift card if you sign on your tour.

## Not Sure Where to Start?

Honestly just [take the quiz](/quiz) — it takes like 30 seconds and ranks all 21 places based on what you care about (budget, distance, bedrooms, amenities).

Or if you want to browse yourself, [check out all the apartments](/explore) or look at the [map](/map) to see where everything actually is.

Look, sometimes it just doesn't work out. Maybe your roommate dipped, you got a transfer, you're studying abroad — whatever. It happens more than you'd think at UT. Here's what you actually need to know.

## Read Your Lease First (Seriously)

I know, boring. But there's probably a clause in there that tells you exactly what your options are. Look for these three things:

- **Early termination clause** — A lot of student leases have one. You pay a fee (usually 2 months' rent) and you're out clean. Best case scenario.
- **Sublease clause** — If your lease allows it, you find someone to take over your spot. Post it on our [sublease board](/subleases) and let someone else grab it.
- **Military/DV clause** — Tennessee law (T.C.A. § 66-28-512) lets you out early for active military orders or domestic violence situations. No fee.

## Your Landlord Can't Just Screw You Over

This is the part most people don't know. Tennessee law (T.C.A. § 66-28-507) says your landlord has to actually try to re-rent your unit. They can't just leave it empty for 8 months and send you the bill. They have to:

1. Put it back on the market
2. Show it to people who ask
3. Accept reasonable tenants

So you're really only on the hook for rent until someone new moves in, plus whatever early termination fee your lease says.

## What to Actually Do

1. **Read your lease** — Or just paste it into our [Lease Help tool](/lease-help) and it'll pull out the important stuff for you.
2. **Talk to your leasing office** — Don't ghost them. These people deal with this all the time, especially at student apartments. Just be upfront.
3. **Get it in writing** — Whatever they agree to, get it in an email or signed document. Don't just take someone's word for it.
4. **Try subleasing first** — Post on our [sublease board](/subleases). It's usually way cheaper than paying the termination fee.
5. **Take photos when you leave** — Protect your security deposit. Document everything.

## What's It Gonna Cost?

Real talk:

- **Early termination fee**: 1-2 months' rent usually
- **Security deposit**: You might lose it if you don't handle this right
- **Rent until it's re-rented**: Could be 1-3 months but landlords in college towns usually fill spots fast

## Bottom Line

It's stressful but it's not the end of the world. The main thing is don't wait. The earlier you deal with it, the less it costs.

Got a lease you need help reading? Throw it in the [Lease Help tool](/lease-help) and it'll break down what you're dealing with.

We've all heard the stories. The roommate who never did dishes. The one who had people over every single night. The one who "forgot" to pay rent for three months. Yeah let's avoid that.

## The Stuff That Actually Matters

Nobody cares if you both like the same music. What actually makes or breaks it:

**Sleep schedule** — This is the big one. If you're out by 10pm and they're up till 3am gaming, you're both gonna hate it. Ask about this first.

**How clean they actually are** — Everyone says they're clean. They're lying. A 2 out of 5 and a 5 out of 5 living together is a disaster waiting to happen.

**People coming over** — Some people want their apartment to be the hangout spot. Some people want it to be quiet. Figure out which one you are and find someone who matches.

**Money** — If you can't agree on a price range you can't agree on an apartment. Get this out of the way early.

## Questions That Actually Tell You Something

"Are you clean?" is a useless question. Everyone says yes. Try these instead:

- "If there were dishes in the sink for 2 days would that bug you?"
- "What time do you usually go to bed on weeknights?"
- "How often do you have people over?"
- "What's your budget per month?"
- "Pets — do you have any or want any?"
- "Do you smoke or drink at home?"

You'll learn way more from these than from "tell me about yourself."

## Red Flags

Run if:
- They dodge the budget question
- Every roommate they've ever had was "the problem"
- They want to skip the lease or do it informal
- They're rushing you to commit
- They won't talk about cleaning or guests

## Try the Roommate Finder

We built a [Roommate Finder](/roommates) that matches you on the stuff that actually matters — sleep schedule, cleanliness, noise, guests, study habits, budget, move-in date.

How it works:

1. **Make a profile** — Takes like 2 minutes. Just be honest.
2. **See your matches** — We sort people by how compatible you actually are.
3. **Match or pass** — Swipe style. If you both match, you get each other's email.
4. **Filter by apartment** — Already know where you want to live? Only see people looking at the same place.

The whole thing only works if you're honest about your habits. Nobody wants to find out their "clean" roommate is a disaster 2 weeks into a 12-month lease.
